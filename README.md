# Idle Master

A simple Steam Trading Cards farming script.
See [jshackles/idle_master_py](https://github.com/jshackles/idle_master_py) for details on the original project.

This is a script I wrote years ago when I wanted to farm Steam Cards,
but the aforementioned project didn't suit me for some reason.
I updated it recently to adapt it to the changes Steam made.

Seems to be running ok on Linux, didn't test it on other platforms.

## Requirements

`requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, `pillow`, `tk`.

## Setup

Put Steam cookies into `config.json`.

Run `python idlemaster.py`.
